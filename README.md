# CS180
This repo is a culmination of a semester's worth of programming, the first programming class I took at Purdue.
All the code was written in Java, and it progressed from writing basic text-based programs to File IO and GUI-based programs which ended in creating a single server interfacing with clients for a basic airline management system.


This repo contains the code written for CS180 Fall 2019 at Purdue by Varun Shah. <br>
***Any copy of this code can result in expulsion from the university and an F in the class.***
